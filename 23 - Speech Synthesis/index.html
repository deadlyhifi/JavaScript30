    <textarea name="text">They're in your room while you're sleeping. They're in your car behind the seat waiting. All the rifle sights are on the
back of your head. They're slipping it into your drink when you're not looking. And they're selling it to you as art. It's
every other word in movies and songs. All the public is buying, it's business as usual, and the business is capitalising
on your fear, your greed, your perversions and vices. They say you're guilty, they've got the evidence to prove it. The mistakes
are obvious, the faults are glaring. The plane is on fire, the fucking ship is sinking. And you're swept away in a hurricane.
You're buried in the rubble of an earthquake. It's terminal, inoperable, they're amputating! Massive hemorrhaging, major
fucking complications! (Â© Against Me! - Miami)</textarea>
